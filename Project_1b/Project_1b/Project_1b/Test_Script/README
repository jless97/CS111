Description of included files (Features):

Testing Methodology:
Unlike for Project 0, no smoke tests were used to test the program in the 
Makefile (as this wasn't required). However, I tested my program by using
incremental programming, and making sure that each requirement of the spec was
functioning correctly as I continued to finish the project. In addition, I
printed out code-specific error messages after each system call, so that I
knew exactly where the error was coming from.

Citations and Research:
- The TA discussion section/slides, Piazza responses, and man pages for the
  used APIs were especially useful for this project
- In addition, the GNU libc Manual was very helpful in researching certain
  features of the project, as well as descriptions of the required APIs
