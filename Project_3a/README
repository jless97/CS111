Description of included files (Features):
—————————————————————————————————————————
(1) lab3a.c: 
  A C source module that compiles into a C program that analyzes and 
  summarizes the contents of a file system.

(2) ext2_fs.h
  Simplied version of the Linux header file that defines the format 
  of the EXT2 file system provided in the spec

(3) Makefile: To build the program (lab3a), but also has two other 
targets: dist (to make the tarball), and clean (to remove all 
generated programs and output).

(4) README
  This README file contains identification information, description of 
  the files included in the tarball, brief answers to each of the 
  questions in the spec, as well as citation of resources that I used 
  to help me implement the program.

Testing Methodology:
————————————————————
The programs were tested using similar methods to previous projects. After
each system call, I had prints to stderr in case any failed, with 
descriptive methods. In addition, when debugging the code, I used printf()
statements throughout to isolate and track down the problems. Finally, the
sample.sh test script was used to make sure that the desired output was
correct and in proper format. 

Citations and Research:
———————————————————————
- The TA discussion section/slides, Piazza responses, and man pages for the
  used APIs were especially useful for this project
  - A good deal of my concerns (and questions) were answered with fairly 
    good clarity from other students, and TA’s
- The websites recommended for studying before beginning the project were
  the main source I used when implementing this project.
- The EXT2 filesystem guidelines link provided was especially useful while
  implementing this project.
