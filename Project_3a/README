Description of included files (Features):
—————————————————————————————————————————
(1) lab3a.c

(2) Makefile: To build the program (lab3a), but also has two other 
targets: dist (to make the tarball), and clean (to remove all 
generated programs and output).

Testing Methodology:
————————————————————
The programs were tested using similar methods to previous projects. After
each system call, I had prints to stderr in case any failed, with 
descriptive methods. In addition, when debugging the code, I used printf()
statements throughout to isolate and track down the problems. Finally, the
sample.sh test script was used to make sure that the desired output was
correct and in proper format. 

Citations and Research:
———————————————————————
- The TA discussion section/slides, Piazza responses, and man pages for the
  used APIs were especially useful for this project
  - A good deal of my concerns (and questions) were answered with fairly 
    good clarity from other students, and TA’s
- The websites recommended for studying before beginning the project were
  the main source I used when implementing this project.
