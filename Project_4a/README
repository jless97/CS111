Description of included files (Features):
(1) edison_selfie.jpg: A selfie of me holding my assembled Edison

(2) ifconfig.png: This screenshot shows that I configured my Edison, and gave
    it a name, password, and configured the network access. In addition, this
    pic shows the MAC address of my Edison, which is => fc:db:b3:92:01:0b

(3) scp_to_edison.png: I created a trivial hello_world program on my local
    machine, and then I sent it over to the Edison via scp. I verified on the
    Edison side, that the file was received

(4) hello_prog.png: This picture shows that I created a hello.c program on
    the Edison, built it, and then ran it as well. As shown, it prints out
    the correct message

(5) opkg_git.png: This picture shows that I downloaded the git package (note:
    I had downloaded it earlier for a previous class, so it just says that it
    is up-to-date). Next, I cloned a repository onto my Edison (which was the 
    from the linked tutorial on the opkg package).
