Description of included files (Features):
—————————————————————————————————————————
(1) lab4b.c: This C program involves the use of the Intel Edison, along
with the Grove kit temperature sensor and button. The program samples
the voltage of the temperature sensor at different intervals (specified
by the —-period option) and converts it to a temperature value (specified
by the —- scale=F/C option). Moreover, the program prints out a report 
(i.e. Timestamp and temperature), and writes the report entries to a log
file (specified by the —-log option). In addition, the program reads in a 
set of commands provided by the user via STDIN.

(2) makecheck.sh: This file contains the smoke tests run for make check

(2) Makefile: To build the program (lab4b), but also has three other 
targets: check (to test the program), dist (to make the tarball), and clean 
(to remove all generated programs and output).

Testing Methodology:
————————————————————
The programs were tested using similar methods to previous projects. After
each system call, I had prints to stderr in case any failed, with 
descriptive methods. In addition, when debugging the code, I used printf()
statements throughout to isolate and track down the problems. Finally, the
sample.sh test script was used to make sure that the desired output was
correct and in proper format. 

Citations and Research:
———————————————————————
- The TA discussion section/slides, Piazza responses, and man pages for the
  used APIs were especially useful for this project
  - A good deal of my concerns (and questions) were answered with fairly 
    good clarity from other students, and TA’s
- The websites recommended for studying before beginning the project were
  the main source I used when implementing this project.
- The mraa() and grove kit temperature sensor documentation pages were used
  to set up the program as well
