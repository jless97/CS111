Description of included files (Features):
—————————————————————————————————————————
(1) lab4c_tcp.c: Extension of Project 4b that uses the Intel Edison and
    the temperature and button sensor to process temperature reports.
    However, instead of polling input for commands from stdin, the input
    is polled from a server, in which the Edison is set up as the client.

(2) lab4c_tls.c: Same program as the tcp version, except that an SSL layer
    of encryption was added on top of it.

(3) Makefile: To build the programs (lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls), but also 
has two other targets: dist (to make the tarball), and clean (to remove 
all generated programs and output).

(4) README

Testing Methodology:
————————————————————
The programs were tested using similar methods to previous projects. After
each system call, I had prints to stderr in case any failed, with 
descriptive methods. In addition, when debugging the code, I used printf()
statements throughout to isolate and track down the problems. Finally, the
sample.sh test script was used to make sure that the desired output was
correct and in proper format. 

Citations and Research:
———————————————————————
- The TA discussion section/slides, Piazza responses, and man pages for the
  used APIs were especially useful for this project
  - A good deal of my concerns (and questions) were answered with fairly 
    good clarity from other students, and TA’s
- The websites recommended for studying before beginning the project were
  the main source I used when implementing this project.
- The mraa() and grove kit temperature sensor documentation pages were used
  to set up the program as well
- I am taking ENGR 96A which is taught by Professor Reiher. He helped me set
  up my SSL connection (as that class also utilizes the Intel Edison).
