# CS 111: Operating Systems

## Background (in progress)
I took this course during my second year at UCLA. This course consists of operating system principles (i.e. virtualization, concurrency, persistence). We have created programs establish IPC connections using uni-directional pipes, and TCP networking using sockets (server/client model). The processes were able to communicate with each other using the polling method. In addition, the IPC mechanism was enhanced by encrypting the data send/received over the network.
